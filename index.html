				<h2><a href="">How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back</a></h2>
				<small>Posted on 27 July 2017 in <a href="">General</a>, <a href="">Development</a>, <a href="">Misc</a>, <a href="">Testing</a></small>
				<p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? I don't want to be rescued. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>

				<p>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
